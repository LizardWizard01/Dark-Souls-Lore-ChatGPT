# Dark-Souls-Lore-ChatGPT
DIGIT 210 Spring 2023 Semester Project

**Stephen Catledge, Tyler Akam**

Our project analyses the various lore entries of Dark Souls and seeks to use AI to replicate them and create original pieces of lore. 

### What's Next:

Currently we are able to use python to feed our data into chatGPT and generate descriptions of original items with a Dark Souls theme. Our next goal is to fine tune this model to return responses in our desired format. We are currently experimenting with OpenAI documentation on fine tuning to accomplish this.

[This](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes) is the OpenAI documentation we have been experimenting with. 

[This](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook) is another useful resource we plan to use.


Ultimately our goal is to have the model output items with clear descriptions in our format and create original characters that can fit in the Dark Souls world.
