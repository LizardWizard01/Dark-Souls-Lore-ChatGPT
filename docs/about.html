            <h1>About the Project</h1>
            <p>The project started as the idea to analyze item descriptions from the Dark Souls 1 using AI. The Dark Souls franchise is known for hiding much of it's lore within in-game item descriptions. The goal was to use these item descriptions to train an AI model to generate original, preferably lore-friendly items. To do this we used ChatGPT and it's AI training documention for python to create a fine tuned model. While the model is still a work in progress, we could try to use these generated items and attempt to create original characters with connections to the items and the world.</p>

                <br>
                Tyler helped prepare information for the website, transform the source files, and worked with python. He assisted in using python to perform natural language processing using spaCy along with studying the documentation available from OpenAI to train the ada model to fit the needs of the project. Lastly, Tyler assisted in working with the CLI to fine-tune the model so that output with prompts could give information that the project could showcase.
