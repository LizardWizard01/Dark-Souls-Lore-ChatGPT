                <figcaption>Below is a .svg image file showing some of our data being processed through
                    cytoscape. At the center is a node labeled "Gwyn", surrounded by and connected to
                    various item nodes. This shows that each of these items mentions Gwyn in their
                    descriptions, or has some connection with Gwyn which makes sense given some context. In Dark Souls,
                    Gywn is a central character who ultimately causes the events of the first game.
                    After killing the dragons, Gwyn built the kingdom of Lordran and began the age
                    of fire. When the first flame began to fade, Gwyn sacrificed himself to prolong
                    it which put a curse on humanity. He and his actions are tied to just about
                    everything in the game, so it makes sense he's in the center, connected to every
                    item. </figcaption>

            <p>This network functions as a way to uncover information on what Natural Language
                Processing(NLP) programs like spaCy can accomplish. Our network focusing on gwyn
                allows one to see the association bewteen him and these items within Dark Souls.
                Using this analysis, we can interpret how AI chatbots read and understand this data,
                allowing for further speculation. Our project started as an idea to have chatGPT use
                in-game item descriptions to generate original, lore-friendly items. Seeing how AI
                interprets the data confirms that this is possible as it's able to make
                connections bewteen descriptions. Using AI can also be useful for people trying to
                understand some of the more hidden lore bits from Dark Souls, as the AI points out
                connections. Seeing Gwyn's relation to each item gives us a unique prespective.</p>
