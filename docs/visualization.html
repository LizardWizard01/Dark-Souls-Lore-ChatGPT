                <figcaption>Below is an svg file image showing some of our data ran through cytoscape. At the center is a node labeled Gwyn surrounded by and connected to various item nodes. This shows that each of these items mentions Gwyn in their descriptions or has some connection with Gwyn which checks out. In Dark Souls, Gywn is a central character who ultimately causes the events of the first game. After killing the dragons, Gwyn built the kingdom of Lordran and began the age of fire. When the first flame began to fade, Gwyn sacrificed himself to prolong it which put a curse on humanity. He and his actions are tied to just about everything in the game, so it makes sense he's in the center, connected to every item. </figcaption>

            <p>This network functions as a way to uncover information on what Natural Language Processing(NLP) programs like spaCy can accomplish. Our network focusing on gwyn allows one to see the association bewteen him and these items within Dark Souls. Using this analysis, we can interpret how AI chatbots read and understand this data, allwoing for further speculation.
            
            Our project started as an idea to have chatGPT use in-game item descriptions to generate original, lore-friendly items. Seeing how AI interperates the data confirms that this is possible as it's able to make connections bewteen descriptions. Using AI can also be useful for people trying to figure out some of the more hidden lore bits from Dark Souls, as the AI points out connections. Seeing Gwyn's relation to each item gives us a unique prespective.</p>
