            <h2>The Rocky Path</h2>
            <p>During our work on the project, we encountered many issues that either simplified,
                slowed, or changed the project. Some of the big issues related to uncovering the
                truth that we could not fine-tune a model for chat completion, having probelms with
                API Keys and navigating the OpenAI system, along with other issues such as having to
                properly format the source file we used. Overall, we faced many roadblocks, but we
                found that we were able to be resourceful enough to find solutions or different ways
                to proceed.</p>
            <!--from here, we'll document more of our bigger issues in detail-->
            <p>At the start of the project, we didn't exactly know what we needed to do in order to
                produce our desired outcome. With the help of Dr. B, we came the the realization
                that we needed to create and train our own Python AI model. To do this we needed to
                find and study OpenAI's documentation on training a ChatGPT model using python. This
                documentation would be the almost all encompassing problem within this project due
                to the fact that we had to learn how to use it as we went. Our main source of help
                was Dr. B, but not even she knew how to implement the documentation all the time.
                Despite this, it was a very interesting learning experience for everyone
                involved.</p>
            <p>Our first real obstacle was creating our first model. With Dr. B's help we were able
                to use the OpenAI documentaion to create a model, but the probelm was using it. In
                order to use our python model we needed an API key. An API key is a string of
                characters that a user can generate in order to use a trained model. The probelm
                came with sharing an API key between us. When an API key is shared, the user is
                notified and the key becomes deactivated. This made it so we could not simply keep
                the API key within a file and share it between us. To solve this probelm we dug into
                the documentation and discovered that we could use a config file. The config file
                would store our API key and be included in our git ignore. Then we would reference
                to our config file at the top of our model which would read the key inside.</p>
            <p>Once we had a working model that was able to output something we had to train it. </p>
            <p>One of the biggest problems we encountered was training a model. We realized that we
                needed to make a fine-tuned model, which required a JSON file. We started to follow
                the basis of the documentation, and tried to do a test within python to get our
                fine-tuned model. This did not work, and we discovered that we needed to make an
                altered version of the JSON file. We tried generating one with a website that turns
                CSV files into JSON, and that did not work, as well as trying to write a few more
                well-written lines. Eventually we got the idea to run RegEx over our data and put
                the prompt completion lines over it. Now, we tried tor un this in python, but we got
                an error again. Our JSON was actually correct, but we could no longer run our file
                in python.</p>
            <p>We discovered that there were some issues with our local devices and python reaching
                for our API Keys that we couldn't figure out how to solve. These issues made no
                sense, as our python had and always has pointed to the config file with our API Key.
                We even tried generating new API Keys, but we could not get it to reach in and use
                it. AS a result, we discovered we can manually reach into the API Key and the JSON
                file to fine-tune in the CLI. We decided to go with this, because we could just
                return to python later. This worked, and we were able to just fine-tune the model
                here. It did take a while, as it would fail for unknown reasons and we would have to
                resume the progress on it. Eventually it completed and all was good. We returned to
                python to recall our fine-tuned model and discovered one final, project-changing
                issue.</p>
            <p>We discovered that we cannot actually train a chat-completion model. OpenAI only
                allows for the training of a completion model, which is basically a less complex
                version of a chat-completion model. The solution to this was to use the Open AI
                playground to view our fine-tuned model, which was saved to our DIGIT PSB
                organization through OpenAI. </p>
