            <h2>The Rocky Path</h2>
            <p>During our work on the project, we encountered many issues that either simplified,
                slowed, or changed the project. Some of the big issues related to uncovering the
                truth that we could not fine-tune a model for chat completion, having probelms with
                API Keys and navigating the OpenAI system, along with other issues such as having to
                properly format the source file we used. Overall, we faced many roadblocks, but we
                found that we were able to be resourceful enough to find solutions or different ways
                to proceed.</p>
