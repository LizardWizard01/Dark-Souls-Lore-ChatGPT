            <h2>The Rocky Path</h2>
            <p>During our work on the project, we encountered many issues that either simplified,
                slowed, or changed the project. Some of the big issues related to uncovering the
                truth that we could not fine-tune a model for chat completion, having probelms with
                API Keys and navigating the OpenAI system, along with other issues such as having to
                properly format the source file we used. Overall, we faced many roadblocks, but we
                found that we were able to be resourceful enough to find solutions or different ways
                to proceed.</p>
            <!--from here, we'll document more of our bigger issues in detail-->
            <p>At the start of the project, we didn't exactly know what we needed to do in order to produce our desired outcome. With the help of Dr. B, we came the the realization that we needed to create and train our own Python AI model. To do this we needed to find and study OpenAI's documentation on training a ChatGPT model using python. This documentation would be the almost all encompassing problem within this project due to the fact that we had to learn how to use it as we went. Our main source of help was Dr. B, but not even she knew how to implement the documentation all the time. Despite this, it was a very interesting learning experience for everyone involved.</p>
            
            <p>Our first real obstacle was creating our first model. With Dr. B's help we were able to use the OpenAI documentaion to create a model, but the probelm was using it. In order to use our python model we needed an API key. An API key is a string of characters that a user can generate in order to use a trained model. The probelm came with sharing an API key between us. When an API key is shared, the user is notified and the key becomes deactivated. This made it so we could not simply keep the API key within a file and share it between us. To solve this probelm we dug into the documentation and discovered that we could use a config file. The config file would store our API key and be included in our git ignore. Then we would reference to our config file at the top of our model which would read the key inside.</p>
            
            <p>Once we had a working model that was able to output something we had to train it. </p>
