            <h1>Examples of Our Trained Model</h1>
            <p>After we discovered that we could not use a Chat Completion model, and only a
                completion model, we were able to use the OpenAI playground to test our model and
                get some output. This was an interesting way to see how all of our hard work on the
                fine-tuned model turned out. We could give the ai a prompt, such as "generate a new
                item", and it would give us back some information. The following examples showcase
                what the prompt was, and how the model completed it. This is a choppy system. It
                works better if the user provides a prompt that starts out with the name of a fake
                item. This allows the completion model to complete the rest of the prompt with a
                generated response that draws from the information that we provided it with in the
                JSON fine-tuned file. </p>

                    was defeated by an unknown foe, and was left to die in Lord Gwyn's grave. His
                    body, head, and all of his weapons were buried in the Darkroot Garden, where
                    they remain ever after.</td>

            <h2>Other Completions</h2>
            <p>Here, we ran the same prompts through the base ada model to show what that model will
                produce! They differ immensely because they pull from information on the internet,
                as opposed to using our specifically trained model. Overall, a trend would be that
                the base model doesn't know that we're talking about Dark Souls, unless we were to
                mention it. This shows how our model is useful in that it actually generates Dark
                Souls related information.</p>

            <p>These examples were generated by our team using the fine-tuned model that we created.
                We decided to try and implement some fake names of items and people that the model
                can try to complete with somewhat accurate information. Some of these completions
                are actually surprisingly filled with information from the game, which proves that
                it is successfully pulling from our fine-tuned JSON file. Some examples of inerest
                include locations such as the Darkroot Garden and Vinheim Dragon School, along with
                people such as Gwyn, who was a primary focus in our Cytoscape networks.</p>
            <p>Overall, the model is able to grab from the information that we fed it, and use it in
                a way that does generate entirely new information. It isn't exactly items, but it is
                relative to the Dark Souls Universe in some way. It has the tendency to go crazy
                (such as repeating the word bloody over and over again), but it is technically
                working. When using the playground, we have the ability to adjust the temperature
                (randomness) of the model, along with string-length and other options that can help
                tweak the model a small amount to influence how it uses the information it was
                provided with.</p>
            <p>The model differs from other models greatly. It pulls specifically from our data and
                quite frankly, is not as intelligent as the base model ada and other ones such as
                davinci. Also, these models utilize the internet (as of a certain date around 2021,
                depending on the model) to answer prompts. Our model specifically uses the
                information we gave it, which is about 800 unique items from the first Dark Souls
                game.</p>

                it may be possible to use ours here. Give it a shot, and see how the model works. If
                our model isn't visible, try using the other models and see what they do compared to
