            <h1>Examples of Our Trained Model</h1>
            <p>After we discovered that we could not use a Chat Completion model, and only a
                completion model, we were able to use the OpenAI playground to test our model and
                get some output. This was an interesting way to see how all of our hard work on the
                fine-tuned model turned out. We could give the ai a prompt, such as "generate a new
                item", and it would give us back some information. The following examples showcase
                what the prompt was, and how the model completed it. This is a choppy system. It
                works better if the user provides a prompt that starts out with the name of a fake
                item. This allows the completion model to complete the rest of the prompt with a
                generated response that draws from the information that we provided it with in the
                JSON fine-tuned file. </p>

                <td>The knight known as Guts was once a high-ranked knight of Lord Gwyn's, but he
                    was defeated by an unknown foe, and was left to die in Lord Gwyn's grave. His
                    body, head, and all of his weapons were buried in the Darkroot Garden, where
                    they remain ever after.</td>

                    School. It is said to have been the domain of the Blight. The sword is imbued
                    with Blight-causing energy, and is said to be a symbol of the blights in
                    Vinheim.</td>

                    iconography includes a lamb, a dead vampire, and a bloody bloody bloody bloody

                    bloody bleeding just the other night and I could not shake it off. It is not the
                    first thing you think about when you hear the word 'messy', but at the games of
                    war that follow the cremation of a knight, it is a constant danger</td>

                <td>The Heltior Gauntlets are the strongest gauntlets in the game, able to withstand
                    heavy hits and attacks.</td>

            <p>These examples were generated by our team using the fine-tuned model that we created. We
            decided to try and implement some fake names of items and people that the model can try
            to complete with somewhat accurate information. Some of these completions are actually
            surprisingly filled with information from the game, which proves that it is successfully
            pulling from our fine-tuned JSON file. Some examples of inerest include locations such
            as the Darkroot Garden and Vinheim Dragon School, along with people such as Gwyn, who
            was a primary focus in our Cytoscape networks.</p>
        <p>Overall, the model is able to grab from the information that we fed it, and use it in a
            way that does generate entirely new information. It isn't exactly items, but it is
            relative to the Dark Souls Universe in some way. It has the tendency to go crazy (such
            as repeating the word bloody over and over again), but it is technically working. When
            using the playground, we have the ability to adjust the temperature (randomness) of the
            model, along with string-length and other options that can help tweak the model a small
            amount to influence how it uses the information it was provided with.</p>
        <p>The model differs from other models greatly. It pulls specifically from our data and
            quite frankly, is not as intelligent as the base model ada and other ones such as
            davinci. Also, these models utilize the internet (as of a certain date around 2021,
            depending on the model) to answer prompts. Our model specifically uses the information
            we gave it, which is about 800 unique items from the first Dark Souls game.</p>
