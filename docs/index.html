            <h1>Weekly Update:</h1>
            <p>This week proved to be more difficult to move forward then we thought. We attempted to follow the OpenAI documention to train our model, but got stuck on finding the best way to set it up. While tryting to convert our text into a JSONL file, we saw that it doesn't fit the prompt/completion format required to train our model. We were having issues with manually writing prompt/completions, but were able to properly format it to have more than 1. Currently that's the easiest way we can think of to train our model, but our goal is to figure out how to use python to do that for us. <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes">Here</a> is the OpenAI documentation we have been experimenting with, and <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook">here</a> is another useful resource we plan to use.</p>
