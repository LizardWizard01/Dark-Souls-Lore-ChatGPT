            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the AI Generated Lore Project! Here, we made it our goal to focus on
                working with ai to generate new information, mainly items, that could function as
                actual items in the Dark Souls universe. This would require them to contain
                lore-accurate information that aligns with how the world of Dark Souls works. On
                this site, you'll find different pages that explain how our pilgrimmage turned out,
                and what we found. There will be visualizations, documentation, discussions,
                problems we faced, and anything else that can accurately explain the process of how
                we (somewhat) trained an ai model to produce information based on the list of items
                found in the first Dark Souls video game. Take a look around!</p>

            <h2>Research Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can Chat GPT generate items that fit into the Dark Souls lore?</li>
                <li>Can we fine-tune an ai model with only information from the first Dark Souls
                    game and get it to output new items?</li>
                <li>Can we see how ai takes information and uses it to generate a response based on
                    a prompt?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are just a few questions that we were asking as we began working with the
                OpenAI system. We wanted to take a look at how ai works within generating new
                information, and potentially using it in a new and unique way. The project initially
                focused on the use of ChatGPT and how we could give it our information in a
                copy-paste format, and it essentially worked. However, bigger ideas came into play
                and the thought of training a model using python became a central point in achieving
                what we want. Over time, this changed how we looked at ai, and raised more questions
                about how it functions. </p>

            <h3>Weekly Update:</h3>
            <p>This week proved to be more difficult to move forward than we thought. We attempted
                to follow the OpenAI documention to train our model, but got stuck on finding the
                best way to set it up. While tryting to convert our text into a JSONL file, we saw
                that it doesn't fit the prompt/completion format required to train our model. We
                were having issues with manually writing prompt/completions, but were able to
                properly format it to have more than 1. Currently that's the easiest way we can
                think of to train our model, but our goal is to figure out how to use python to do
                that for us. <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tunes"
                    >Here</a> is the OpenAI documentation we have been experimenting with, and <a
                    href="https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook">here</a> is another useful
                resource we plan to use.</p>
