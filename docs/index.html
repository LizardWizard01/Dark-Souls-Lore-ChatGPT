            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the AI Generated Lore Project! Here, we made it our goal to focus on
                working with ai to generate new information, mainly items, that could function as
                actual items in the Dark Souls universe. This would require them to contain
                lore-accurate information that aligns with how the world of Dark Souls works. On
                this site, you'll find different pages that explain how our pilgrimmage turned out,
                and what we found. There will be visualizations, documentation, discussions,
                problems we faced, and anything else that can accurately explain the process of how
                we (somewhat) trained an ai model to produce information based on the list of items
                found in the first Dark Souls video game. Take a look around!</p>

            <h2>Research Questions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can Chat GPT generate items that fit into the Dark Souls lore?</li>
                <li>Can we fine-tune an ai model with only information from the first Dark Souls
                    game and get it to output new items?</li>
                <li>Can we see how ai takes information and uses it to generate a response based on
                    a prompt?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are just a few questions that we were asking as we began working with the
                OpenAI system. We wanted to take a look at how ai works within generating new
                information, and potentially using it in a new and unique way. The project initially
                focused on the use of ChatGPT and how we could give it our information in a
                copy-paste format, and it essentially worked. However, bigger ideas came into play
                and the thought of training a model using python became a central point in achieving
                what we want. Over time, this changed how we looked at ai, and raised more questions
                about how it functions. </p>

            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p>Throughout our experiences working with OpenAI and the AI models, we learned a lot.
                The potential of artificial intelligence is great, and using it effectively is a
                challenging task. During the process, we learned a lot about Python and how we can
                use it as a tool. We went more in-depth into different branches of coding and text
                analysis in general by making use of programs like spaCy and PANDAS, along with
                becoming more familiar with different file types such as JSON files, SVG, and more.
                The use of all of these tools allowed us to reflect on how we interacted with the ai
                model and learned about ai as a whole. We mainly came to the conclusion that ai are
                very particular and that it takes a lot to train one and make it useful. We were
                able to produce an ai model based off of an existing model, and that proved to be
                difficult. However, we were able to speculate and analyze how ai models work, and
                how they think; that is that they operate off of hypotheticals and a plethora of
                examples. We also discovered how the ai uses fine-tuned JSON files to look at the
                examples and base its thought process off of the provided information. From our
                experiments, we found that this works. Essentially, we've been able to take a dive
                into the brain of an ai and understand how similar words and tokens were able to be
                used as associations that can be made into viable results in the output of a
                prompt.</p>

            <p>This week we are gathering data from cytoscape and our newly trained model. We plan to update our website with this and other information in prepartion for the DIGITWorks showcase. </p>
