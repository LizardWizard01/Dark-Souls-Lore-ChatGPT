            <h1>From the beginning</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>We started this project by wanting to compare the in-game lore of weapons, armor, and other items in the video game Dark Souls with results that could be generated from the openai chatbot, ChatGPT. </p>
            <p>Our goal was to simply run prompts through chatGPT and get a fictional set of items that are generated by the chat bot and would have the ability to function as actual in-game lore. With that in mind, we were planning on evaluating the similarities and differences between the existing set of items from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nU-PlT4giFSGspGPTtZmt8XS2cPw4pCuf__J0Izfqqw/edit?usp=sharing">google sheet we discovered</a> and our fictional set that would be generated.
            </p>
            <p>To start this process, we had to be able to scrape the information that we needed from the google sheet. We started looking at resources for Python that could allow us to do this, but soon realized there was a much simpler way to achieve this. We copied the columns we needed into a new excel sheet, and then exported it as a text file. This came with a few more bits of work, but ultimately it was what we wanted. The last steps to output only the item type, name, and description were fairly simple. We performed simple regEx to clean up the “\n” characters and other spaces that appeared when we output it to a text file.
            </p>
            <p>From here, we discovered that we could simply tell ChatGPT to generate new items and put them in the format we desire. However, this was too simple. We decided we could work on using API Keys and OpenAI to train our own chatbot to fulfill a purpose of making a set of generated items that are entirely fictional, but based on what information we feed it. From this, we began work on using the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference">Open AI documentation</a> to begin writing Python that performs this task. With some help from other sources giving us <a href="https://discusschatgpt.com/training-your-own-chatgpt-model-a-step-by-step-tutorial/">overviews of the system</a>, we began to learn more about training an AI to make our idea work.
            </p>
            <p>Soon after getting our API Key working and being able to communicate with the ada model in GPT-Turbo 3.5, we realized we still have much work to do in making our AI work for us. The method for achieving this lies in utilizing fine-tuning. This involves creating a ruleset that our model follows so that instead of manually telling the model what we want to see for examples, it has background information that it applies so that it can do more with less in the prompt given. For fine tuning, we looked at the <a href="https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook">Open AI Cookbook</a> and the <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning">Fine-Tuning documentation provided by OpenAI</a> </p>
            <p>From here on out, we are still working on the Python for fine-tuning the model so that we can have it output our information specifically.

            <br/>
            <p>Eventually, we will have different parts of the page that will be viewable and will show the results of our tinkerings with OpenAI. We will be looking at different aspects of the source files, and comparing them with our eventual outputs from our trained model. This will allow us to study the creativity and intelligence of the current AI system, along with learning how to work with AI models.  Overall, some major goals of this project are to gain a better understanding of AI models, compare generated results with ideas by humans, and analyze the errors made by the models.
